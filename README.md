# Netflix Clone

This project is a Netflix clone built using HTML and CSS, aimed at replicating the look and feel of the popular streaming platform. This clone doesn't include actual streaming functionality, it mimics the layout, design, and responsiveness of Netflix's website.

Features:
1. Responsive design: The clone is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing a seamless viewing experience across various devices.
2. Home page layout: It includes a similar layout to Netflix's home page, featuring sections for different categories, movie posters, and a navigation bar.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the web pages.
2. CSS3: Utilized for styling and layout design, including responsive design principles.
3. JavaScript (optional): Can be used to enhance interactivity and dynamic features (not extensively used in this project).
